        <h3>Cooking</h3>

        <p>AJ's introduction to gourmet cooking came about from a childhood friend, Gio Pratti. Gio would later become AJ's roommate at the University of Akron. While Gio attended University of Akron's culinary arts program, he would share the skills, techniques, and knowledge learned with AJ.</p>

        <p>As time went on AJ embraced the culinary skill as a dedicated craft and acquired a solid array of tools and cookware. Part of that dedication included ample time experimenting with everything from ethnic dishes to the charcoal grill, the smoker, the gas skillet and even a butane wok.</p>

        <p>AJ has taken advantage of numerous free and paid online programs. Like all of his hobbies he approached cooking with dedication and "a fever for fusion cuisine."</p>

        <p>As a fun fact, mixology also known as bartending, was something he did for 13 years (1995 - 2008). So while he no longer works at Buffalo Wild Wings #3 in Akron Ohio he can sling some tasty concoctions with your dinner.</p>
