        <p>The golf started at age 14 on the Cuyahoga Falls municipal sports golf school at Brookledge Golf Course in Ohio. AJ fell in love with this sport that his enthusiasm persists to this day as a beloved passionate pursuit.</p>

        <p>Golf expert Ray Cable took on AJ as a student of the game in 2009. Mr. Cable taught all manner of golf in all of its various aspects. Perhaps most important for AJ's skill was the deep appreciation for the art of the short game Mr. Cable instilled into him. AJ credits ray with Mr. Cable for "Everything real that I know about golf I learned from Ray. All the things that books don't teach and instructors don't have the time to instill."</p>

        <p>AJ is luckier than most golfers I know. The interest in golf spans his entire family. He regularly enjoys rounds of golf played with his father and siblings at various courses.</p>
