        <h3>AJ on Learning a Hobby</h3>
        <p>You have to find something that interests you. That which you seek, seeks you.</p>

        <p>You will find yourself able to learn things readily if its something that you're desperately interested in. You have to find something that really trips your trigger, and when you do you chase it. Start finding experts in the field, you have to try to go beyond what the average person would do, just searching Google.</p>

        <p>You have to run in those circles of the people who do that type of thing. You have to learn the lingo. You have to be accepted by them.</p>
