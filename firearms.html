        <p>Firearms has been a lifelong interest for AJ. Naturally it reached an apex point in the Army Ordnance Corps. Since AJ pursues his hobbies to the nth detail his interest expanded into hand loading, <a href="https://uspsa.org" target="_blank">USPSA</a> target shooting events, as well as various precision rifle contests and matches.</p>

        <p>AJ has always been an advocate for safety. He not only talks the talk but he took action. AJ eventually obtained and still holds certifications in pistol, rifle, and as a range safety officer.</p>

        <p>AJ believes that shooting is a perishable skill, a skill that must be practiced on a routine basis. In addition to practice, he believes that a good shooter must push to become constantly better. That las point is something AJ does with his golfing and cooking skills</p>
