        <h3>Welcome</h3>

        <p>I would like for you to meet my buddy AJ.</p>

        <div class="mobile">
          <p>AJ has surprisingly accomplished quite a bit in his life so far. He is one of those guys that knows a little bit about everything but does not act like an annoying know-it-all. AJ is one of those nice and friendly approachable people that you have no problem talking to asking questions on any topic.</p>

          <p>AJ is also an honest guy. If he does not know the answer to something, he will tell you. Chances are pretty good that not knowing will drive him to find the answer for you. Personally, I believe it is due to this drive for knowledge that he has learned so much over the years on so many different topics.</p>

          <p>We have worked at the same company but in different departments for many years. Eventually we wound up working together for the same company in the same building. We are just on different teams.</p>

          <p>This site is going to offer you a glimpse into the person that is my buddy AJ.</p>

        <div class="mobile">
          <p>He recently purchased a house here in North Carolina. He has already formed strong relationships with people scattered about North and South Carolina while maintaining his close ties to friends and family in other states.</p>

          <p>While he enjoys his career, he does have opportunities to move into something new, either with our company, a startup, or some other company.</p>

          <p>He has served honorably in the US Army Reserves. His time in the Army Reserves has let him travel around the world. He has obtained a bachelor’s degree from a state university.</p>

          <p>He loves his family, cooking, the outdoors, motorcycle adventures, golfing, and firearms. Moving to North Carolina has been a great decision. The location is close to many venues for his passions. They can go camping any in of the many camping areas in North Carolina. The Blue Ridge Parkway is always a great time on a motorcycle, and the fact that Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is not too far as to miss Bike Week. Even for golf our location is an excellent location with numerous courses to chose from that you can play almost year-round.</p>
