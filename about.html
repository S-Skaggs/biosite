        <p>AJ grew up around the <a href="https://www.cityofcf.com/" target="_blank">Cuyahoga Falls</a> area in Ohio.</p>
        <p class="tablet-desktop">
          He attended k-12 with a focus on college preparatory courses. Most of his teenage years were spent rebuilding engines and racing cars. In fact his idea of a fun Saturday was to pull the engine from a friend's car and work on it.
