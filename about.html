        <h3>AJ's Beginning</h3>
        <!-- TODO: use an image of house, city skyline... -->
        <p>AJ grew up around the <a href="https://www.cityofcf.com/" target="_blank">Cuyahoga Falls</a> area in Ohio.</p>
        <p class="tablet-desktop">He attended k-12 with a focus on college preparatory courses. Most of his teenage years were spent rebuilding engines and racing cars. In fact his idea of a fun Saturday was to pull the engine from a friend's car and work on it.</p>

          <p>After highschool AJ briefly attended <a href="https://www.kent.edu/" target="_blank">Kent State</a> in Ohio. By briefly, he means for a single semester before joining the <a href="service.html">Army Reserves</a>. After serving in the Army Reserves he would graduate from the <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">University of Akron</a> with a BS of Fine Arts in Graphics.</p>
          <p>While obtaining his BS, AJ became a member of Delta Tau Delta. You could think of this as a requirement as his parents were some of the first members. He enjoyed his college experience. In addition to his degree he also came out with several good friends that he keeps in touch with today.</p>

          <p>After college AJ found gainful employment with a company named Enigma Solve. At Enigma Solve he would work on websites including creating some shopping carts. This was all during the Wild West days of the Internet back in the late 1990s.</p>
          <p>He eventually left Enigma Solve and went to work for Time Warner Cable. While at Time Warner Cable he found himself doing some really fun work. Work that not only included creating websites, but creating content geared towards the new cable modem industry. At that time there was not much on the Internet to really challenge the speed of a cable modem. Time Warner Cable started creating what they called Around Town sites. These sites had a team local to their area or region who would create the websites and content with a local focus.</p>
          <p>Some examples of the content included, but was not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Filming and streaming the recorded video of local highschool sports</li>
            <li>Filming and streaming the recorded video of local special interest stories</li>
            <li>Creating feeds on the Around Town site from local news and community outlets</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It was during the Around Town days and some time after that AJ and I started to work together, just on different teams.</p>
          <p>Eventually Time Warner Cable was purchased by Charter Communications, you may know them as Spectrum. As part of the reorganization developers who wanted to stay with the company had to relocate to either Charlotte, NC or St. Louis, MO.</p>
          <p>Luckily for me, AJ chose Charlotte, NC. Mainly due to weather, and other perks that allow him to enjoy some of his favorite hobbies.</p>
